					<p>Dental implants are one of the most important developments in the realm of dentistry because they provide patients with teeth that look and feel natural. Unlike dentures or partials, implanted teeth are designed to last permanently. Caring for implants is also much easier than taking care of dentures and partials. Simply brush and floss as usual.</p>

						<h2>Who Should Consider Dental Implants?</h2>
						<p>There are a wide variety of patients who end up choosing implants over other options based on the benefits and their particular circumstances. SOME COMMON REASONS ARE:</p>

							<p>When someone suffers a traumatic face injury that causes severe damage, implants are usually the best option to restore their teeth to a natural-looking state. This is especially true with patients who are otherwise too young to consider dentures.</p>
							<p>How do dental implants work for these patients? The most important factor is the permanent solution provided by implants. Having implants put in will also help maintain the shape and structure of a patient’s face. Over time, people missing several teeth will start to appear different physically. Some people describe it as a sort of “sunken” facial appearance, or it could look like someone’s face is stuck in a frown.</p>

						<div class="common-reasons__item-copy effects effects--fade">
							<p>Sometimes, a patient is missing a single tooth, but the rest of their teeth are in good shape. In this case, an implant could provide a permanent solution that will not require any special care after the initial recovery period. The patient can still eat all the same foods and care for their implants in the same way as they would their natural teeth.</p>
							<p>Other options, such as a partial denture require special care that many people consider to be an inconvenience. For instance, they often have to be removed while eating. This tends to cause a certain amount of embarrassment for people, especially if they are eating out in public. A partial will also have to be removed for cleaning.</p>

							<p>Implants are also an option for patients who would otherwise need a full set of dentures, but do not want to deal with the restrictions and special care involved.  A process known as all-on-four implants is popular with denture candidates. Basically, a full set of dentures is installed on four implant posts. This provides the permanent, aesthetic and convenience of implanted teeth at a better price.</p>

					<h2>What Are Dental Implants</h2>
					<p>Dental implants are widely considered to be the most effective option to replace a missing tooth, or several teeth. Once a damaged tooth is removed by a dentist, the visible part of the tooth known as the crown as well as the root of a tooth are gone.</p>
					<p>A dental implant is inserted into a patient’s jaw bone. This is essentially a replacement root that will fuse with the jaw bone and create a solid foundation for the replacement crown. Implants can either be used to replace an individual tooth or support a bridge or all-on-four dentures.
					<p>No other procedure can produce a result that is so close to natural, healthy teeth. Patients who have had this procedure find that they are no longer embarrassed to smile, laugh, eat and face the world in many different ways.</p>

					<h2>How do Dental Implants Work Over Time?</h2>
					<p>Dental implants hold up extremely well over time, which is part of the allure. Daily care is no different than taking care of your natural teeth. Brush and floss as usual and don’t forget to show up for regular check-ups and cleanings with your dentist.</p>
					<p>One advantage of dental implants is that cavities will o longer be a concern. However, that doesn’t mean they are not subject to wear and tear, so don’t slack on brushing, flossing and regular checkups. If you properly care for your implants, there is no reason why they should not last a lifetime.</p>

					<h2>Are Dental Implants <span>Expensive?</span></h2>
					<p>While implants do tend to cost more than other alternatives for missing teeth, the advantages cannot be understated. When considering the cost, it helps to look at implants as a lifetime investment. The benefits of their longevity as well as the confidence and self-esteem which will be restored truly is priceless.</p>
					<p>It’s also important to remember that no two patients are alike. When it’s time to determine the cost of dental implants, the best way to get an accurate estimate is to schedule a consultation. Sometimes, bone grafting will be necessary to ensure the jaw is strong enough to handle the implant.</p>
					<p>If the tooth loss was a result of bacterial infection or gum disease, further treatment could be required before you are healthy enough for implants. Taking the correct steps prior to the implant surgery will greatly increase the chances your surgery will be successful.</p>
					<p>Thanks to advancements in modern dentistry, the success rate for dental implants is upwards of 98 percent. If you think this could be an option for your, schedule an appointment with a qualified cosmetic dentist to determine if this procedure is right for you.</p>
